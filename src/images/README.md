# Component Images

This directory contains the images for the different component types in the service game.

## Required Images

The following images are required for the game to work properly:

- `server.png` - Image for the Server component
- `database.png` - Image for the Database component
- `cache.png` - Image for the Cache component
- `api_gateway.png` - Image for the API Gateway component
- `load_balancer.png` - Image for the Load Balancer component
- `users.png` - Image for the Users component

## Image Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Size: 96x48 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- Background: Transparent (recommended)
- Style: Isometric or top-down view of the component

## Adding Your Own Images

1. Replace the placeholder images with your own images.
2. Make sure the filenames match the component types (e.g., `server.png` for the Server component).
3. If you don't have images yet, you can use the placeholder images generated by the `create-placeholder-images.js` script.

## Generating Placeholder Images

If you don't have your own images yet, you can generate placeholder images using the `create-placeholder-images.js` script:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install canvas
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   node create-placeholder-images.js
   ```

This will generate placeholder images for each component type with the appropriate colors.
