# Retrieving Previous Chat History (2025-04-18 14:31:33)

_**User**_

I can't find the last chat we just had when I didn't have any project open

_**Assistant**_

I understand you're looking for a previous chat, but I should clarify something: I don't have access to chat history from previous conversations. Each conversation with me starts fresh, and I can only see and respond to messages within our current chat session.

If you had a previous conversation in Cursor without a project open, that conversation would have been a separate session, and I unfortunately cannot access it. You might want to:

1. Check your Cursor chat history if that feature is available in your IDE
2. Try to recall the key points from your previous conversation and share them with me, so I can help you with those topics
3. Simply ask your questions again, and I'll be happy to help you with them

Is there a specific topic or question from your previous chat that you'd like to discuss now?
